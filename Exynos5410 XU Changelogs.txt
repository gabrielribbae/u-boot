Porting Exynos5410 u-boot to recent version.

The following documentation has as goal to keep record of changes done to get a modern version of u-boot on the ODROID-XU.

The main assumption is that the Exynos5410 shares the same definitions of the modern drivers incorporated to the Exynos5 family on u-boot.
Having that on mind, most changes are related with match name definitions to the actual driver structures and some custom parameters according to the old u-boot for smdk5410.

Compilation notes:

- Compilation done using gcc-arm-9.2-2019.12-x86_64-arm-none-gnueabi toolchain. I've used this link as reference
(https://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/build-u-boot-and-linux-kernel-from-source-code#Toolchain_for_Hard_Float_Calling_Convention).

- Before compiling, it is necessary to export config using "source ~/export_compiler".

- After compiling, you will have spl/smdk5410-spl.bin and u-boot.bin, if you build it.

- To flash bootloader, there's a sd_fusing.sh script on u-bootv2012.07/sd_fuse/smdk5410/

06/11/2020

Changes required for XU:

- Compare smdk5410 source files and header files with respect to mach-exynos to check compatibility between 5410 and exynos5/5250/5420.

Changes already done:

- Added CONFIG_EXYNOS5410 and CONFIG_SMDK5410 into config_whitelist.txt.
- Added exynos54xx-odroidxu-leds.dtsi, exynos-syscon-restart.dtsi, exynos5420-trip-points.dtsi, exynos5410-odroidxu.dtb and exynos5410-smdk5410.dtb into EXYNOS5 section from /arch/arm/dts Makefile
- Added exynos5410.h and exynos-audss-clk.h clock from linux/include/dt-bindings/clock/ to u-boot/include/dt-bindings/clock/ to fix 5410 dtb compilation.
- Added samsung.h from linux/include/dt-bindings/pinctrl/ into u-boot/include/dt-bindings/pinctrl/.
- Added samsung-i2s.h from linux/include/dt-bindings/sound/ into u-boot/include/dt-bindings/sound/.
- Changed exynos54xx.dtsi and exynos5.dtsi to versions from linux mainline to support exynos5410 definitions.
- Add exynos5410_get_pll_clk case on arch/arm/mach-exynos/clock.c get_pll_clk definition around line 1634.
- Bypassed ddr3_mem_ctrl_init error changing dmc_init_ddr3.c line 25 to include EXYNOS5410_CONFIG definition.
- Added CONFIG_EXYNOS5410 into u-boot/tools/Makefile to fix compilation error.
- Removed all exynos5 based boards from u-boot/arch/arm/dts/Makefile due to dts mismatch related to porting exynos54xx.dtsi and exynos5.dtsi from linux repo to u-boot.

07/11/2020

Changes required for XU:

- Compare smdk5410 source files and header files with respect to mach-exynos to check compatibility between 5410 and exynos5/5250/5420.

Changes already done:

- Modified buildroot/operating-system-dev/buildroot/boot/uboot/Config.in, uboot.mk and odroid-xu-defconfig to add custom local u-boot repo.

Troubleshooting notes:

- Debug says that some definitions don't exist and they have been commented out. They are:
    
    CONFIG_EXYNOS5410 from /include/configs/exynos5410-common.h (Partially solved on 06/11/2020)
    CONFIG_SMDK5410 from /include/configs/smdk5410.h (Partially solved on 06/11/2020)
    CONFIG_DEFAULT_CONSOLE from /include/configs/smdk5410.h

- It appears that exynos5410-odroidxu.dtb is not created succesfully. The message says 'Device Tree Source is not correctly specified.'. A workaround is to copy
  dtb directly from precompiled binaries for linux kernel (Solved on 06/11/2020)

- Debug says 'Undefined reference to 'ddr3_mem_ctrl_init'. That's because dmc_common expects CONFIG_EXYNOS5250 or CONFIG_EXYNOS5240
  but in exynos5410-common.h neither was defined. Maybe it requires a custom EXYNOS5410 section, but it seems that 5250 is the default option for Exynos5 family
  excluding 5420.

- Checking /arch/arm/cpu/armv7/exynos/clock.c from u-boot v2012.07 it seems that no additional definitions than 5410_get_pll_clk is required with respect to u-boot 2020.
  Their function definitions are quite the same in terms of names.


Relevant compilation logs:

- arm-linux-gnueabi-ld.bfd: arch/arm/mach-exynos/built-in.o: in function `mem_ctrl_init':
  /home/osboxes/Desktop/u-boot/arch/arm/mach-exynos/dmc_common.c:164: undefined reference to `ddr3_mem_ctrl_init'
